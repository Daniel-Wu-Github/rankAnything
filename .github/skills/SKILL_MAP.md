# Skill Map

This file is the central source of truth for repository skills.

All agents must do these steps before using or editing skills:

1. Read this file first.
2. Load only the smallest sufficient skill set for the task.
3. If any skill is added, removed, renamed, or scope-changed, update this file in the same change.

## Selection Order

1. Classify the task (domain, risk, lifecycle stage).
2. Load [repo-workflow](repo-workflow/SKILL.md).
3. Load [scope-creep-guard](scope-creep-guard/SKILL.md) for every task before planning or edits.
4. For any UI, visual, or frontend task, load [frontend-design](frontend-design/SKILL.md) and [ui-ux-pro-max](ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md).
5. For documentation maintenance, load [documentation-cohesion](documentation-cohesion/SKILL.md).
6. Add cross-cutting skills as needed in this order:
  1. [skill-map-governance](skill-map-governance/SKILL.md)
  2. [verification-gate](verification-gate/SKILL.md)
  3. [workflow-logging](workflow-logging/SKILL.md)
  4. [remote-commit-logging](remote-commit-logging/SKILL.md)
  5. [detailed-chat-output](detailed-chat-output/SKILL.md)
  6. [self-improvement-loop](self-improvement-loop/SKILL.md)
  7. [skill-improvement-loop](skill-improvement-loop/SKILL.md)

## Skill Registry

| Skill | Path | Purpose | Load When |
|---|---|---|---|
| repo-workflow | [repo-workflow/SKILL.md](repo-workflow/SKILL.md) | Maintain instruction and workflow surfaces | Any customization or workflow maintenance task |
| scope-creep-guard | [scope-creep-guard/SKILL.md](scope-creep-guard/SKILL.md) | Enforce explicit phase boundaries and prevent out-of-scope edits | Every task, before planning or edits |
| frontend-design | [frontend-design/SKILL.md](frontend-design/SKILL.md) | Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics | Any UI, visual, or frontend task on big-board.html |
| ui-ux-pro-max | [ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md](ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md) | Comprehensive UI/UX design intelligence: 50+ styles, 161 palettes, 57 font pairings, 99 UX guidelines | Any design system, component, or layout decision |
| documentation-cohesion | [documentation-cohesion/SKILL.md](documentation-cohesion/SKILL.md) | Ensure fixes integrate naturally and remain readable by humans and AI agents | Creating or refining planning docs, taskboards, prompts, or specification documents |
| skill-map-governance | [skill-map-governance/SKILL.md](skill-map-governance/SKILL.md) | Keep the skill map synchronized with the skill catalog | Any skill add/remove/rename/scope change |
| verification-gate | [verification-gate/SKILL.md](verification-gate/SKILL.md) | Enforce verification before completion | Any task that edits files, config, or process docs |
| workflow-logging | [workflow-logging/SKILL.md](workflow-logging/SKILL.md) | Capture decisions, progress, and change records | Material process or instruction updates |
| remote-commit-logging | [remote-commit-logging/SKILL.md](remote-commit-logging/SKILL.md) | Automatically log pushed commits by branch as detailed commit history | Tasks that add or maintain commit history automation |
| detailed-chat-output | [detailed-chat-output/SKILL.md](detailed-chat-output/SKILL.md) | Keep output structure clear and complete | Multi-step or high-risk tasks that need clear traceability |
| self-improvement-loop | [self-improvement-loop/SKILL.md](self-improvement-loop/SKILL.md) | Improve instructions after mistakes or drift | Repeated errors, stale docs, or avoidable rework |
| skill-improvement-loop | [skill-improvement-loop/SKILL.md](skill-improvement-loop/SKILL.md) | Summarize mistakes, evaluate skill effectiveness, and improve skills | Skill quality issues or missed auto-loading behavior |

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep skills non-feature-specific unless implementation code requires otherwise.
- Keep each skill narrow with explicit use and non-use guidance.
- Prefer updating existing skills over creating near-duplicates.
- Keep paths and links in this map valid.

## Change Log Requirement

When this map changes, include a short note in the same PR or commit message that states:

- what changed in the registry
- why the change was needed
- what tasks now load the new or revised skill
