# Plan Review Prompt

Read the repository architecture and relevant planning docs, then review current changes strictly against acceptance criteria.

Focus only on:

1. Shared contracts completeness and drift.
2. Validation envelope consistency.
3. Package/env/runbook completeness.
4. Scope violations (premature business logic).
5. Missing tests.

Output:

- findings (highest severity first)
- missing deliverables
- exact files to edit

Do not edit files in this mode.
